# Sky-Auto-Piano (Revamped Fork Edition)

This is a **revamped version** of the original [Sky-Auto-Piano](https://github.com/HerokeyVN/Sky-Auto-Piano) created by [HerokeyVN](https://github.com/HerokeyVN). Special thanks to the original developer for building such a solid foundation.

This project builds upon the existing SkyAutoPiano app by fixing bugs and adding a few features to enhance the user experience.

## ✨ What's New in the Revamp

### 1. 🔍 Search Bar Functionality

Added a search bar to quickly filter and find specific music sheets, making navigation easier and faster.

### 2. 🌙 Light/Dark Mode Toggle

A redesigned dark mode UI with the ability to toggle between light and dark themes. Offers users more comfort and visual customization.

### 3. ⚙️ Config & Long Press Bug Fix

Fixed an issue where `Long Press` mode and custom sheet speed (e.g. 0.8x) settings were not being properly applied after restarting the app. The settings now persist and function correctly on relaunch.

### 4. 🗂️ Minimize Window Switch

Added a toggle in the settings to allow the user to minimize the app to the taskbar, offering better window control
